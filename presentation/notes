What's an operating system
  (joke) Its something like zephyr
  Is an application
  Runs applications

What's an application
  A recipe telling a CPU what to do
    Single entry point

What's a recipe
  Looks like a crater on Mars

What's a thread
  Isolated execution context

  No macro with thread

  Build for emul

I made a game once
  Unity

What's up with main?
  Are we building an application?

Main main main
  Example

Zephyr's main
  Example

Do we need main?
  Remove main example
    branch kernel-no-main
  Useful for samples
  Recognizable
  Use the bg thread for something

Modules using system work queue
  design (start stop interact)

branch workq_run
branch thread-patch

* synchronization not required for work queue
* user space (use multiple work queues)
* LED manager
* Huge notes joke (I memorized everything)
* compare work queue with cooperative threads, realize they are identical.
* lets remove "main", have the thread be the system thread, first init, then workqueue
* how to deal with work at init
* "sharing is caring", obviously true because it rhymes, like "new year, new me"
